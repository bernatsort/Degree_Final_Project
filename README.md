### üìùAbout the project 
Nowadays, the gold standard measurement to assess the level of lung failure is the respiratory SOFA score, which is based on an invasive method at a low sampling rate. 
Our hypothesis is that this gold standard method to assess the level of lung failure could be surrogated by a non-invasive and at a high sampling rate SpO2-based approach. 
In order to prove our hypothesis and accomplish our goal, we have set specific aims, which are:
- Implement an Extraction, Transform and Load (ETL) process to obtain a ready-to-analyze dataset from the latest update of the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care database (MIMIC-IV). 
- Characterize the relationship between the SpO2/FiO2 ratio and the PaO2/FiO2 ratio. 
- Develop a new score of lung failure using the SpO2/FiO2 ratio based on the gold standard respiratory SOFA score.
- Evaluate the performance of the new score against the gold standard using a battery of ML classification algorithms to predict mortality.

### üí°Suggestions 
We suggest opening the code in Colab to visualize the interactive plots properly.
